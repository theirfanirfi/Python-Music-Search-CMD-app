# NOTE: This example also illustrates a few things involving file access and manipulation.

from os import path, walk
from fnmatch import fnmatch
from mutagen.easyid3 import EasyID3


def showMusic(glob, directory):
    for (top, dirs, files) in walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if fnmatch(file, glob):

                # "Normalizing the path just for safety"
                # This makes sure all of the path separators are correct for the OS etc..
                mp3FilePath = path.normpath(path.join(top, file))

                try:
                    media = EasyID3(mp3FilePath)
                    data = {  tagName:tagValue[0]   for tagName,tagValue in media.items()}

                    tmplt = "Found: {artist} {album} {title}"
                    print(tmplt.format(**data))

                except Exception as e:
                    print("Could not read: " + file + " " + str(e))
